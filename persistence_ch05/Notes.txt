These plotting scripts are for making plots that investigate the response of simulated communities to the change in one parameter.

Currently we look at:
1. MAI ratio 
2. Reproduction rate (for MAI = 0.0 and 0.5)

These standardised scripts make it easy to switch between these cases to ammend the plots (which are saved in the figures directory for chapter 5)

It will alos make it easy to analysis any further simulations we may want to run e.g.

1. R.R. for MAI = 1.0 
2. Increasing number of repeats (cureently 22 - WOULD NEED CHANGING IN SCRIPTS)
3. Testing response of another parameter e.g synthesis ability.
